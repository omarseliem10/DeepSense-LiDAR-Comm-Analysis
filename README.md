LiDAR Integration for Communication Systems 🚀

This repository presents a Python-based implementation of **LiDAR integration into wireless communication systems**, focusing on **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)**. The project leverages **LiDAR point cloud data** and **beam power measurements** to analyze and visualize wireless communication behavior in real-world environments.

---

📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how LiDAR and communication data can be combined to:

- Analyze beamforming patterns and identify the best beam indices.
- Visualize real-world positions of users (UE) and the base station (BS) on satellite images.
- Generate interactive 3D point clouds from LiDAR scans for spatial analysis.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from **DeepSense**, a platform providing datasets for wireless communication and sensing research. For more information, visit: [DeepSense Website](https://deepsense6g.net/)

## 🚶‍♂️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1️⃣ **Prepare the Data**
Ensure the `scenario32.csv` file and the corresponding unit folders (e.g., `unit1`) are placed correctly in the project directory.

### 2️⃣ **Run the Code**
To execute the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3️⃣ **Output Overview**
The script performs the following tasks:

- **Power Analysis**: Plots beam power distributions across selected samples.
- **Satellite Image Mapping**: Overlays user positions and best beam indices on satellite images.
- **LiDAR Visualization**: Displays dynamic 3D point cloud animations.

## 🧠 Understanding the Code

### **Key Components:**

1. **Beam Power Analysis**
   - Reads `scenario32.csv` to retrieve relative file paths.
   - Loads beam power measurements and visualizes the power distribution for selected samples.

2. **User Position Mapping**
   - Utilizes GPS positions to map user locations on a satellite image.

3. **LiDAR Point Cloud Visualization**
   - Uses **Open3D** to create 3D point cloud animations.
   - Applies voxel down-sampling and statistical noise removal for clarity.

## 📊 Sample Results

### **Beam Power Distribution**
The following plot shows the power distribution of selected beam indices for different samples:

- **X-axis:** Beam indices (1-64)
- **Y-axis:** Power level

### **GPS Mapping**
The map generated by the script displays user positions with color-coded best beam indices, plotted over a satellite image from Google Earth.

### **LiDAR 3D Visualization**
The point cloud animation presents real-time 3D representations of the environment based on LiDAR scans.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### **1. File Not Found Errors**
Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed correctly.

### **2. Open3D Issues**
If Open3D visualization doesn't work, try updating Open3D or running the script as an administrator.

### **3. Beam Power Anomalies**
Make sure the CSV file correctly corresponds to the LiDAR and GPS files.
